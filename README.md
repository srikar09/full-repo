# full-repo

Goals:
1. Remove the last two commits from `develop` branch and push to remote
2. Create a PR against `master` and resolve conflicts
3. Create a branch called `experimental` without file2 off `develop`. Take a snapshot of this branch and create another repo called `partial-repo`. `partial-repo` should only have 1 commit.
4. Make changes on `experimental` and make only the history made after `partial-repo` to reflect on `partial-repo`
5. Make changes on `develop`, make the these changes reflect on both `experimental` branch as well as on `partial-repo`.
